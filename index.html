    <p>I have a truly amazing woman in my life Whitney who has put up with me and also has blessed me with two amazing kids Jaxon and Majine</p>
    <p>I have been a Cook for 14 years and a Chef for 10+years. I have a very strong passion for Agriculture and the Food System.</p>
    <p>I am currently adding more dynamics to my skill set, learning to code fulfills my passion for mathmatics. My son also loves numbers and enjoys computers.</p>
    <p>I hope to take these skills and launch a new career in Coding!</p>
